# TitleCaseUpper
JavaScript function I made to change the first letter of every word to uppercase - A FreeCodeCamp exercise 
This is one of the first functions I wrote completely on my own and I'm documenting it mostly for my own use because I feel like explaining each line will help me understand it better.

The most Important thing I learnt from this is KISS - Keep it simple stupid. The original plan was to create two arrays: One with all the upper case Letters, and another with all the lower case words minus their first letters. Then I would somehow zipper join them together putting the first upper[1] with words[1] and then upper[2] with words[2] and so on. I don't even think that's a thing you can do but oh well, I know that now.
